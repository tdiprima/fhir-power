Yup â€” that error's 100% legit and very common. You're hitting this:

`"Unknown resource type 'auth'"`

ðŸ§  Translation: You're trying to access a path like `/auth/token`, but this FHIR server **doesn't support that as a valid REST endpoint**. It's a **FHIR-only server**, not a SMART-compliant one.

### ðŸ”¥ The Problem:
You're using the wrong base URL for SMART.

You used:

```python
FHIR_BASE = "https://r4.smarthealthit.org"
```

That **only supports FHIR**, not the SMART auth layer.

### âœ… The Fix:
Use a **SMART-compatible test launch instance**.

Try replacing the base URL with this one (it's made for SMART apps):

```python
FHIR_BASE = "https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/sim/eyJhIjoiMSJ9/fhir"
```

This URL:

- Supports both FHIR **and** the SMART OAuth endpoints
- Works with the SMART App Launcher
- Is preloaded with a test patient and everything you need

### Update This Too:
Change your SMART auth URL generation block to this:

```python
AUTH_BASE = "https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/sim/eyJhIjoiMSJ9"  # no /fhir here
FHIR_BASE = AUTH_BASE + "/fhir"
```

Then update your launch URL to:

```python
launch_url = (
    f"{AUTH_BASE}/auth/authorize?"
    f"response_type=code"
    f"&client_id={CLIENT_ID}"
    f"&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}"
    f"&scope=launch patient/*.read openid profile"
    f"&aud={FHIR_BASE}"
    f"&state=xyz"
)
```

And your token URL to:

```python
token_url = f"{AUTH_BASE}/auth/token"
```

### ðŸ§ª Try Again

Once you:

- Replace the URLs
- Rerun the Flask app
- Use the SMART App Launcher with your `http://localhost:8000/launch` URL

...you should get:
ðŸ‘‹ "Hello, John Smith!" (or whoever the test patient is)
